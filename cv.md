## About me
I am interested in constant self-learning and have already completed several courses. I try different spheres of reality and it makes me happy and fills me with energy.  
My goal is to find a field of activity in which I want to stay forever.

## Skills
* Python (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab)
* SQL (MySQL, SQLite)
* Data libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, SciPy.stats)
* Algorythms for Machine Learning (LogisticRegression, LinearRegression, RandomForest, DesicionTree)
* Gradient Boosting Algorythms (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM)
* Digital art in Procreate (iOS) / Adobe Photoshop
* Vector art and design in Adobe Illustrator
* Animation in Adobe After Effects
* HTML and CSS

## Code example
```
function validatePIN (pin) {
  //return true or false for PIN
  let a = /^[0-9]+$/.test(pin) && (pin.length == 4 || pin.length == 6);
  return a;
}
```

## Projects

| № | **Project name** | **Description** |
| -- | ---------------- | --------------- |
|1. |[Determining the age of buyers by their photo](https://github.com/AlishaMv/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/age_determination/age_determination.ipynb)|We have at our disposal a set of photographs of people with age indications. Based on the set, we got a model for predicting age from a photo.|
|2. |[Predicting the cost of cars](https://github.com/AlishaMv/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/auto_price_prediction/auto_price_prediction.ipynb)| The data were analyzed: technical characteristics, configurations and prices of cars. The model was trained to determine the market value of the car.|
|3. |[Forecasting the outflow of bank customers](https://github.com/AlishaMv/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/churn_clients_bank/churn_clients_bank.ipynb)| Based on historical data on the behavior of customers and termination of agreements with the bank, a model was built with an extremely large value of the F1-measure. The probability of a client leaving the bank in the near future is predicted and a predictive model is built.

## English language

Level: В1 

Practice:  
I live in Turkey now and I have a practice of communicating with the locals.  
Sometimes I go to an English speaking club.  
I also try to devote half an hour a day to English on the Lingualeo app.
